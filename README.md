The fast-forward merge is a merge that occurs when the branch being merged has no new commits that aren't already in the branch being merged into. In other words, it means that the branch can "fast forward" and be on the same commit as the branch being merged without creating a new merge commit.

Conflict
If a new paragraph is added to conflict branch and a new paragrpah is added to develop before the merge on the same line, it will create a conflict.
If a new paragraph is added to conlict branch and a new paragrpah is added to develop before the merge and they are not on the same line, it will not cause a conflict.
